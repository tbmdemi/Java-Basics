# Java Coding Skill Improvement Through In-Class Exercises

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents the journey of improving Java programming skills through a series of in-class exercises. Each exercise focuses on core programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and design patterns — all implemented and refined during class sessions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of Java syntax and semantics.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles in real scenarios.
- Practice writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
- Learn to solve problems efficiently using Java.
- Track progress and reflect on key lessons learned through each task.


Each folder contains:
- `*.java` source files
- A `README.md` or `notes.md` explaining the concept covered
- Optional: a `.txt` or `.md` file summarizing key takeaways

## ✅ Skills Covered

- Java syntax and control flow
- Classes, objects, and constructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Exception handling
- File I/O
- Collections Framework
- Basic algorithms and data structures

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Language: Java 17+
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- JDK: OpenJDK 17 and above
- Optional: Git for version control

## 📖 Learning Approach

1. **Read** the theory or lecture note.
2. **Code** the exercise in class or as homework.
3. **Test** and **debug** the implementation.
4. **Reflect** on lessons learned.
5. **Document** in a short note per topic.
